# Contributing

This repository is sanctioned by Microsoft and therefore there are some contribution guidelines to follow. If you want to contribute directly, you need to have a Github account. But we know not all of you know how to use Github or want to learn. If you have ideas and would like to submit them outside Github, we will be coming up with mechanisms to cover those situations.

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.
