# Sharing-Is-Caring Contribution Guidance Opportunities

## First time PnP Contribution
Contributing to the OfficeDevPnP for the first time may seem intimidating, but is actually quite simple. In fact the only requirements are a free GitHub account and a web browser. 

Personal and hands-on guidance is available to you for completing your very first OfficeDevPnP contribution. 

The Sharing-Is-Caring repository provides the opportunity to walk you through, from start to finish, your first OfficeDevPnP pull request and the contribution tutorial will even count as an official contribution, placing your name on the contributor list for that month! 

The following Sharing-Is-Caring first time contribution tutorials are available:

### Monthly scheduled live, hands-on tutorial
Each month, a pre-scheduled, live hands-on session is available for first time OfficeDevPnP contributions. 

**The session will provide the following hands-on experience for each attendee:**
* SharePoint development documentation updates using GitHub
* Submitting documentation updates such as spelling and grammar corrections with a GitHub pull request
* Understanding of the OfficeDevPnP pull request process, including providing a useful and accurate pull request description. 
* For each attendee, a personalized documentation update will be prepared, allowing all attending to experience the pull request process, from start to finish. 

Session Requirements:
* Free GitHub account
