## -- PnP SPFx Sample Updates Contribution using the Office365 CLI --

### Upgrading SPFx Samples with the Office365 CLI "Project Upgrade" Command
If you would like to contribute to the SPFx PnP initiatives, but don't yet have any of your own custom samples, there is still an opportunity to contribute. Existing samples, which have been created and submitted using an older version of SPFx, can be upgraded to the newest version of SPFx using the "Project Upgrade" with the [Office365 CLI](https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/). The updated sample can then be submitted back into the original sample PnP repository using a GitHub pull request. 

A sample upgrade contribution helps by keeping the SPFx samples updated and counts as an official PnP contribution.
