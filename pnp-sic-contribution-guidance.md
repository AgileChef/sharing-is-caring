## First time PnP Contribution
Contributing to the OfficeDevPnP for the first time may seem intimidating, but is actually quite simple. In fact the only requirements are a free GitHub account and a web browser. 

Personal and hands-on guidance is available to you in making your very first OfficeDevPnP contribution. 

The Sharing-Is-Caring repository provides the opportunity to walk you through, from start to finish, your first OfficeDevPnP pull request and it even counts as an official contribution, putting your name on the contributor list for that month! 

The following hands-on Sharing-Is-Caring tutorials are available:
